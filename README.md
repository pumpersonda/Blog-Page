# Blog Page

 A micro-CMS system for a personal use blog using React JS and local storage.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Local Storage
The project insert some Posts in the website if the localstorage is empty. After that everytime you save post on the web, this one will be saved on localstorage until you delete all localstorage again.  


## Libraries
For this project I use these external libraries:

 -  typescript
 - react-router-dom
 - classnames

 

## Available Scripts

  

In the project directory, you can run:

  

### `npm start`

  

Runs the app in the development mode.\

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

  
The page will reload if you make edits.\

You will also see any lint errors in the console.


  

### `npm run build`

  

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

  

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

Your app is ready to be deployed!
